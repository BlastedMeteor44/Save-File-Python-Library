# Save File Python Library
This is a non published python package that lets you make save files for video games!<br>
**I used it for my text based RPG 2.0.** <br>

Commands:<br>
Read_line: reads a specific line from a file.<br>
- Example: read_line(myfile.txt, 3)<br>
- Reads line 3 from myfile.txt.<br>

Replace_line: replaces a specific line from the file.<br>
- Example: replace_line(myfile.txt, 2, "hi blud")
- Replaces line 2 from myfile.txt with "hi blud"

**To install, just copy the code from main and paste it at the top of your code.** <br>
**You will need to add all the lines to the save file beforehand, as this prgram cannot create lines or replace text on lines that aren't there.** <br>
**Some text editors will allow you to collapse the "if 1 == 1:" at the top of the code, hence why it is put there.**
